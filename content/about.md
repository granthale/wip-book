## Thesis
As you peruse, you'll notice that this isn't your average blog. Full essays are rare. Instead, connected [[atomic ideas]] are the norm. This writing style goes by many names - [evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes), [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/), and [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) are a few. We prefer [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

We chose this format because we believe that **the chronological blog is an artifact of the past**. [[Powerful Ideas|Powerful ideas]] stay relevant over time. Most platforms bury authors work regardless of whether they're still fertile. This platform is a [joyful subversion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aalyplbv5Mo) of that.

Here's a visual description of a digital garden by the talented [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com):

## How do we write?
We each write slightly differently but are shaped nonetheless by this medium. You'll notice two types of writing - notes and pieces. **Notes** are smaller and more atomic. They tend to cover one idea and are the building blocks for our full-fledged writing and thinking. They're meant to be debuggable and let us put signposts in the ground on what we're learning. **Pieces** on the other hand, are whole ecosystems in and of themselves. Each piece likely builds on many notes and aims to fully develop an idea.

Each piece or note can be in three different stages. When we have new thoughts, we plant **seeds**. They allow us to start writing, and get something in public quickly. As we nurture, revise and update those thoughts, they quickly become **saplings**, full of connections but not fully finished. Finally, as our writing becomes ever-more polished, it becomes **evergreen**. These notes are the bedrocks of our thinking and the platform.

## Who's we?
Our names are [[grant|Grant]] & [[sam|Sam]]. We're two good friends in the early stages of life. We met in 2023 while backpacking through Taiwan, and are now back at work in the US and Switzerland respectively. Despite busy professional lives, we're continuing to learn and think by asking and answering dynamic questions. This website is the fruit of that pursuit.

## Onwards and upwards!
We hope you enjoy our writing, if for no other reason than the different approach. This website is very much a work in progress and we'd love to hear from you. Reach out @ ==TODO== and stay curious!

**p.s.**
*Before you leave, check out [[Agricultural Influences|the people who inspired this website]]. They've expanded the way we think about learning & writing. We know that if you enjoy our garden you'll certainly enjoy theirs.*
