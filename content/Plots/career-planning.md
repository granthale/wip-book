"Career planning = career limiting", instead think in terms of opportunities and skills

## How to think about risk?
- Think about career as a portfolio of jobs/roles/opportunities
- When presented with an opportunity, analyze it's risks in the context of our lifetime portfolio
- There is generally no opportunity without risk
- Pay attention to opportunity cost

## What industry?
- Go to an industry where the founders are still working. It will be vibrant and full of opportunities for young, determined people.
- Go to an industry that is likely to seriously benefit humanity

## Where to live?
- Go to the center of the industry (e.g., for AI, San Francisco) or where the most change is happening (e.g., for fintech, Africa).
- International experience is also great to broaden our perspective and become a better global operator

## What skills are worth learning, and how do you learn them?
- Communication (read, write, go to a comedy class)
- Management (work under a great manager)
- Sales (spend a year as a salesperson)
- Finance (learn from others, or read)
- International (work abroad)
- Something hard and technical (school or professional responsibility)

## How good to be at them?
- It's rare that someone will be top 1% in a certain skill; 
- It's more important to stack multiple skills; be the top 25% in 3–4 skills, and suddenly you're qualified to be the CEO; work on developing multiple skill sets

## How to learn decision-making?
- Put skin in the game; put myself in situations where things can go wrong, and where I live and breathe by my decision making ability

## How to learn from each industry / opportunity?
>"⁠⁠Think strategically: how would I start a firm like this today? Or, if I were starting a company in this industry today, how would it be different than this firm? Why is this firm and other firms in this industry doing what they do? What are the assumptions underneath their behavior? Should those assumptions be changing? How might this industry work differently? Which customers are being underserved? What new technologies might change things completely? How were things working 10 years ago, versus today, versus 10 years from now? And, my favorite: if the creators of this industry were starting out today, what would they be doing now?⁠⁠"

— Marc Andreessen

## Working at a startup vs. growth-stage vs. big company?

[The Generalist Disease](https://www.danhock.co/p/generalist-disease) by Dan Hock
> "Generalism is not the goal. It is just a means of goal-seeking to find what it is you really want to do. Ultimately you must specialize to build real leverage, which requires the exact opposite of increasing optionality. It means being intentional about taking options off the table.
> ... 
> You ultimately need to switch to chasing aptitude and enjoyment. If you can find something you are naturally pretty good at and enjoy enough to spend a lot of time on, ultimately you will become very good at it and learn to enjoy it even more. That creates a compounding advantage."

[Eventually You Will Get What You Deserve](https://nav.al/eventually) by Naval & Nivi
> "Your eventual outcome will be equal to something like the distinctiveness of your specific knowledge; times how much leverage you can apply to that knowledge; times how often your judgment is correct; times how singularly accountable you are for the outcome; times how much society values what you’re doing. Then you compound that with how long you can keep doing it and how long you can keep improving it through reading and learning."

> "One of the great things about looking for a job is that your “payoff” is almost always a max function (the best of all attempts), not an average. This is also generally true for raising VC financing, doing bizdev partnerships, hiring programmers, finding good advisors/mentors, even blogging and marketing."

[How To Design Your Career](https://www.maxmarchione.com/p/career-design) by Max Marchione
> "Here’s the insidious myth of career design: “You need to know what you want to do.” In reality, **searching for career certainty is career-limiting.** Why? Searching for certainty results in:
> 1. Naively copying others
> 2. Becoming closed off to better opportunities"

> "**There’s a point when you need to stick with something for the long term to compound gains**. That’s how compounding works. Simple."
