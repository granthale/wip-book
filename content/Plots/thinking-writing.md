## Why write?
- [More People Should Write](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write) by James Somers
- [Writes and Write-Nots](https://www.paulgraham.com/writes.html) by Paul Graham
- [My 12 Favorite Problems](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/my-12-favorite-problems?__readwiseLocation=) by Ted Gioia

These pieces are about more than just writing — they're about the importance of being preoccupied with a question. They are about our life having clear unifying threads. 

Writing is then the tool to grow, deepen, revise, and bat around our thinking over time

## How to post?
> Consider levels on the following (0-5) online scale:
- Absent-Lurker-Commenter-Poster/Blogger-Organizer-Leader. You could have a similar offline scale: Absent-Silent-Talker-Presenter-Organizer-Leader.
- My rule of thumb would be: Assume that you are ready to be one level higher than you think you are ready for. [Zvi](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/04/09/youre-good-enough-youre-smart-enough-and-people-would-like-you/)**

If we are to learn, it seems more appropriate to write beforehand. This helps us define our questions, preoccupations, and as [Richard Hamming puts it](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html), "our hooks". Our outputs and inputs are very much in conversation, and thinking and writing benefit from [our milieu](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/first-we-shape-our-social-graph-then).
