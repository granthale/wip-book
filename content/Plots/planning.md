[Cal Newport's Planning System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FipKTzkTD4&__readwiseLocation=)
**Documents**
- Values (include best practices for mental health practices)
- Strategic plans (link to other long term documents as useful, quarterly or semester-long, review strategic plans 1x per week, overhaul 2x a year)
	- Career
	- Personal

**Productivity**
- Values plan (any values that need to be shored up)
- Weekly plan (flexible, very complicated weeks require lots of thought)
- Daily plan (create time block plan based on weekly plan and value plan)

**Daily shutdown**
- Rough but intentional plan for time following shutdown
- Process any outstanding tasks

**Discipline**
- Core disciplines to follow as strictly as possible (sometimes tracked using a habit tracker)

[My Approach to multi-scale planning](https://www.asyncagile.org/blog/multi-scale-planning)
- When planning for performance review
	- Identify focus area
	- Identify all goals
	- Prioritize goals
	- Break goals down into activities
	- Ask what evidence proves I've accomplished this
	- Identify support needed to succeed
- Weekly planning
	- Put dummy event at beginning of week with personal and professional goals
	- Put time down to review goals at the end of the week

[On the structured pursuit of depth](https://calnewport.com/on-the-structured-pursuit-of-depth) & [Cultivating a deep life](https://calnewport.com/cultivating-a-deep-life/?__readwiseLocation=) & [Mindset](https://calnewport.com/more-on-cultivating-a-deep-life-mindset/)
>"The deep life cannot be reduced to concrete steps. But without concrete steps, you’ll never get closer to it."
- Resist the urge to create a master plan, instead plan one month at a time; list 1 habit to amplify and 1 habit to reduce across craft, community, contemplation, constitution 
- This is a long term practice; when done month after month, I will get closer to the deep life
- ==Do less, do better, know why (work backwards from my values)==

[Brandon Sanderson advice on doing hard things](https://calnewport.com/brandon-sandersons-advice-for-doing-hard-things/)
>“I can do hard things. Doing hard things has intrinsic value, and they will make me a better person, _even_ if I end up failing.”
- Choose goals you have control over (e.g., not "become a professional author", instead "write 10 books, each one better than the last")
- Learn what combo of motivation, circumstances, and accountability work for me (e.g., habit trackers, deadlines, writing groups)
- Create an accurate roadmap of what needs to be done; talk to people who have done it before and learn what really matters and what doesn't (it's easy to create stories around what I think is important vs. what really is)

**The 5 Best Time Management Tips (for ultra busy people)**
1. Be honest with people on why I'm declining (this will make others value my time and commitment, force me to be honest with myself on what's more important, free up mental energy)
2. Make a list of all my tiny annoyances and resolve them
3. If it's not on my calendar, it doesn't exist
4. Get info out of brain and into systems/paper
5. For decisions that don't matter that much, just make the decision and move on

[Anti-planning](https://calnewport.com/do-more-by-planning-less-the-power-of-the-anti-plan/)
- Instead of planning ahead for what needs to get done when — dive in and keep a record of my experience throughout (thoughts, triumphs, frustrations)
- Shorten reflection cycles and adjust approach
- Unsaid, but there should be a goal or question that we're working towards

## Open questions
- How to define values?
- When is it important to leave room for ambiguity?
