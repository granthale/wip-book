[The Generalist Disease](https://www.danhock.co/p/generalist-disease) by Dan Hock
> "Generalism is not the goal. It is just a means of goal-seeking to find what it is you really want to do. Ultimately you must specialize to build real leverage, which requires the exact opposite of increasing optionality. It means being intentional about taking options off the table.

> You ultimately need to switch to chasing aptitude and enjoyment. If you can find something you are naturally pretty good at and enjoy enough to spend a lot of time on, ultimately you will become very good at it and learn to enjoy it even more. That creates a compounding advantage."

[Eventually You Will Get What You Deserve](https://nav.al/eventually) by Naval & Nivi
> "Your eventual outcome will be equal to something like the distinctiveness of your specific knowledge; times how much leverage you can apply to that knowledge; times how often your judgment is correct; times how singularly accountable you are for the outcome; times how much society values what you’re doing. Then you compound that with how long you can keep doing it and how long you can keep improving it through reading and learning."

> "One of the great things about looking for a job is that your “payoff” is almost always a max function (the best of all attempts), not an average. This is also generally true for raising VC financing, doing bizdev partnerships, hiring programmers, finding good advisors/mentors, even blogging and marketing."

> "Searching for certainty results in:
> 1. Naively copying others
> 2. Becoming closed off to better opportunities"
> 
> "**There’s a point when you need to stick with something for the long term to compound gains**. That’s how compounding works. Simple."
