These pieces are about more than just writing — they're about the importance of being preoccupied with a question. They are about creating clear unifying threads.

Writing is then the tool to grow, deepen, revise, and bat around our thinking over time

## Non-writing, writing
- Use Twitter to develop seeds, sharpen later via long form
- Have great conversations

## How to use writing to learn?
Instead of diving into answering a question immediately, it's usually more powerful to formulate a hypothesis first. This primes our brain to absorb information if the answer turns out differently from what we were expecting. Writing is an easy way to define these questions, preoccupations, and ([as Richard Hamming would call them](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)) "hooks". 

Then, once we learn, having written our hypothesis, we can now improve our intuition. When compared to a thought (which is easily influenced by hindsight bias), writing is immutable. This lets us reflect on why we were wrong, and what mistaken assumptions that led to our conclusion.
