These pieces are about more than just writing — they're about the importance of being preoccupied with a question. They are about our life having clear unifying threads. 

Writing is then the tool to grow, deepen, revise, and bat around our thinking over time

## How to use writing to learn?
If we are to learn, it seems more appropriate to write beforehand. This helps us define our questions, preoccupations, and as [Richard Hamming puts it](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html), "our hooks". Our outputs and inputs are very much in conversation, and thinking and writing benefit from [our milieu](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/first-we-shape-our-social-graph-then).
