## How to get started writing?

- Consider levels on the following (0-5) online scale:
	- Absent-Lurker-Commenter-Poster/Blogger-Organizer-Leader. You could have a similar offline scale: Absent-Silent-Talker-Presenter-Organizer-Leader.
	- My rule of thumb would be: Assume that you are ready to be one level higher than you think you are ready for. [Zvi](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/04/09/youre-good-enough-youre-smart-enough-and-people-would-like-you/)**
