[How to Increase Motivation & Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLQRAMZi--c&t=42s) by Huberman
Dopamine discovered in late 1950s as a precursor to adrenaline (called epinephrine in brain), but it's not always precursor > biases us for movement

Released from several sites, but most importantly from our reward pathway
- "Accelerator" — VTA sends out axons to nucleus accumbens and releases dopamine
- "Brake" — prefrontal cortex

Motivation is about balancing pleasure and pain
- Sitting at rest, it's usually firing at 3-4x per second, but if we get excited about something (when we start thinking about it), the firing in this pathway increases 30-40x
- It's traditionally believed to be released in response to sex (100% above baseline), food (50% above baseline), nicotine (150%), cocaine/amphetamine (1000x), etc.
- But it's most released when anticipating something — the brain can increase dopamine as much when thinking about this as when experiencing it
- Video games with constantly novel terrain can increase dopamine somewhere between nicotine and cocaine

For every bit of pleasure, there is some amount of pain — when you eat a piece of chocolate, it shifts away from dopamine, and releases some downwards deflection (makes you want more)
- Every time you consume something, the associated amount of dopamine decreases, and the associated amount of craving increases (less pleasure, more pain over time)

Satiety is about serotonin, oxytocin, prolactin > "Molecule of More" calls these the "here and now molecules" — they allow us to experience pleasures in the pleasant
- Eating, which is normally dopamine-driven, can be done more mindfully which can shift things from dopamine to serotonin
- Marijuana and opioids hits serotonin hard, which makes us more content with what we have
- The goal is a balance between serotonin and dopamine


**Two types of procrastinators**
	1. People that enjoy the stress, and which it motivates them
	2. Those that lack enough baseline dopamine

==The longer you can extend the pleasure of an achievement (the dopamine release), and limit the pain, the less painful and more sustainable work will be==
- After doing something meaningful, continue to take myself back to it, and actively work on enjoying it
- Achievements can be considered an addiction if left unchecked
- [ ] Does this actually increase dopamine or just helps balance the system?

Adjust the dopamine schedule
