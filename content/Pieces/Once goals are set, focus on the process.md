It's great to set goals — they can act as north stars. But once they're set, it's easy to overly fixate on them and lose sight of the process. 

How can I stay more present and derive more joy from the process?
- Zoom in until steps are concrete (e.g., draft a bullet point outline vs. write an essay); clear next steps enable flow, while ambiguity requires constantly switching between planning and working
- Measure process — set and celebrate process-related goals (e.g., write for 30 minutes); closed loops create momentum
- Keep a running log of tiny improvements and appreciate the progress (e.g., evolution of a cleaner sentence, tighter arguments, faster feedback cycles)
- Leave open threads at the end of a session (e.g., a highlighted question or next experiment); this allows my next working session to start more easily (also useful for conversation)
