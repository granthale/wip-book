Here's the system I use to orient myself to what's most important, and consistently steer towards it (contra [the drunken sailor step](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)).

### **Once a quarter**
1. Revisit my 3-5 core values[^1]
2. Based on my values, revisit my 30-year-old definition of success[^2] (these are outcomes)
	- Y-axis = 3-5 core values
	- X-axis = internal/external outcomes[^3]
3. Based on my definition of success, set quarterly checkpoints (outcomes) and systems (processes) to continue moving towards this goal
4. Other things I'm experimenting with
	- Defining why I'm doing what I'm doing (big lofty connection back to family, friends, and desired impact)
	- [Defining my 12 favorite problems](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/my-12-favorite-problems?__readwiseLocation=)
	- Creating a learning syllabus

### **Weekly**
1. On Sunday mornings, review my last week and plan out the upcoming week — how granular I plan will depend on how complicated the week will be (often I just plan out the big questions/pursuits I want to get to each day; this usually takes ~1 hour

### **Daily**
1. Shut down for the day — write down any outstanding tasks and schedule them
2. Plan the next day in detail — ideally, every minute is planned (this will undoubtedly change, but I find it useful to be this intentional); this usually takes ~10–20 minutes

### **Before and after each working session**
1. Before — do all my meta-thinking; i.e., set an intention (what I want to achieve) and make a plan[^4]
2. After — review / celebrate what I finished and identify one moment of joy[^5]

[^1]: In my case — vitality (mental and physical health), curiosity, courage, mastery, connection
[^2]: I'm planning to experiment with longer-term definitions of success at ages 50 and 80
[^3]: E.g., an internal outcome could be "regularly excited to meet new people" while as an external outcome could be "surrounded by people who energize, challenge, and care deeply"
[^4]: While creating a scaffold at the beginning of the session can be less fun than just getting right to work, I find that I end up getting much more done, and having more fun while doing it
[^5]: I've been emphasizing finding joy in my work and enjoying the process rather than just trying to reach the outcome
