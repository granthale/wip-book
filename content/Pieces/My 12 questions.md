It's a beautiful thing to be rich in questions - taking inspiration from [Ted](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/my-12-favorite-problems?__readwiseLocation=), I've compiled a list of the 12 questions I find myself returning to most.

Many sit within "direction setting" and "building blocks" — which I think of as enablers. As I answer these questions, I'll shift my attention towards "impact".

## Direction setting
- How to reach [[My planning system|my definition of success]]?

- Where do I want to live?

- What do I want to work on?

- Who do I want to spend my time with?

- What makes me feel alive? What's most fun to me? 

- How would I describe my personal set of ethics? From what traditions can I take inspiration?

## Building blocks
- How to build and maintain a pain free, strong, limber body that is both performant and long-lasting? 

- How to understand, address, and grow through my self stories and mental tendencies? 

- How can creativity, intellectual vitality, wonder, and learning be maintained in the face of inescapable obstacles — such as earning a living, or aging, or financial hardship, or residing far from major cultural centers?

- How to think, learn, and communicate more effectively?

## Impact
- Why are most parties so boring? (i.e., how to build enduring communities and culture?)

- How to build humane technology and use it in a way that promotes (rather than) disrupts a good life?
