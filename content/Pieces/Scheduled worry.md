To train my ability to timebox rumination and be more deliberately present throughout the day, I've been experimenting with scheduling time to worry.

**My protocol looks something like this:**
- Schedule a consistent time and place to worry (e.g., 4:45pm on my couch)
- As worries arise throughout the day:
	- If they're ruminative, jot down in notebook along with the associated cognitive distortion
	- If problem-solving is appropriate, time-box finding a solution to the problem and then move on (10 minutes usually does the trick)
- During my "worry time" (15 minutes)
	- Separate worries into what I can control and what I can't control
		- For what I can control — identify concrete next steps
		- For what I can't — practice accepting and taking a lesson for the future
