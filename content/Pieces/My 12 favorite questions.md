Taking inspiration from [Ted](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/my-12-favorite-problems?__readwiseLocation=), I've compiled a list of the 12 most salient questions in my life today.

Most currently sit within "direction setting" and "building blocks" - which strike me as enablers. Over time, I'd like to see my attention shift towards "impact".

## Direction setting
- How to reach my definition of success?

- Where do I want to live?

- What do I want to work on?
	
- Who do I want to spend my time with?

- What makes me feel alive? What is most fun to me? 

- How would I describe my personal set of ethics? From what traditions can I take inspiration?

## Building blocks
- How to build and maintain a pain free, strong, limber body that is both performant and long-lasting? 

- How to understand, address, and grow through my self stories and mental tendencies? 

- How can creativity, intellectual vitality, wonder, and learning be maintained in the face of inescapable obstacles - such as earning a living, or aging, or financial hardship, or residing far from major cultural centers?

- How to think, learn, and communicate more effectively?

## Impact
- Why are most parties so boring? How to build enduring communities and culture?

- How to build humane technology and use it in a way that promotes (rather than) disrupts a good life?
