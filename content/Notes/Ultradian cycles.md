[Leveraging Ultradian Cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsODSDmY4CY&t=75s) by Huberman

Huberman tries to get at least one, usually two 90-minute sessions of work on something cognitively challenging, per day
- He tries to do this every day, (even on the weekends) â€” circuits for focus are plastic and strengthened when used repeatably

These 90-minute cycles are more apparent while sleeping, but most people don't know when ultradian rhythms begin
- These fluctuations are caused by our glucocorticoid system
- I can figure out where I am in the cycle by asking "when am I most alert after waking?"

Glucocorticoids peaks early in the morning before leveling out throughout the day, but(!) they don't actually level out entirely, they bounce up and down, which continues to shift our ultradian cycles (so it's not e)
