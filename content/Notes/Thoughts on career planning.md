**"Career planning = career limiting", instead think in terms of opportunities and skills**

## How to think about risk?
- A career is a portfolio of jobs/roles/opportunities; when presented with an opportunity, analyze its risk in the context of the lifetime portfolio
- There is no opportunity without risk
- Pay careful attention to opportunity cost

## What industry?
- Choose an industry where the founders are still working; it will be vibrant and full of opportunities for young, determined people

## Where to live?
- Go to the center of the industry (e.g., for technology, SF), but maybe go to where the most change is happening (e.g., for fintech, Africa).
- International experience is also great to broaden our perspective and become a better global operator

## What skills are worth learning, and how do you learn them?
- Communication (read, write, go to a comedy class)
- Management (work under a great manager)
- Sales (spend a year as a salesperson)
- Finance (learn from others, or read)
- International (work abroad)
- Something hard and technical (via school or work)

## How to be valuable?
- It's rare that someone will be top 1% in a skill
- It's a much higher likelihood for excellence to stack multiple skills (i.e., to be top 25% in 3–4 skills); suddenly I'm qualified to be the CEO; prioritize developing multiple skill sets

## How to learn decision-making?
- Put skin in the game; put myself in situations where things can go wrong, and where I live and breathe by my decision-making ability

## How to learn from each industry / opportunity?
>"⁠⁠Think strategically: how would I start a firm like this today? 
>
>Or, if I were starting a company in this industry today, how would it be different than this firm? 
>
>Why is this firm and other firms in this industry doing what they do? What are the assumptions underneath their behavior? Should those assumptions be changing? 
>
>How might this industry work differently? Which customers are being underserved? What new technologies might change things completely? 

> How were things working 10 years ago, versus today, versus 10 years from now? 
> 
> And, my favorite: if the creators of this industry were starting out today, what would they be doing now?⁠⁠"
