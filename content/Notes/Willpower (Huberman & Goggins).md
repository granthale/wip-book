[How to build willpower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ) by Huberman and Goggins

The Anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC):
- Grows when people do things they don't want to do
- stays enlarged in those that live to a very old age
- Is larger in athletes
- Grows when people see themselves as going through and overcoming a challenge

==We can build this area; but if we don't consistently do hard things and things that scare us, then the aMCC atrophies==

=="There are no hacks"== The moment of maximal "suck" is a great place to learn about myself and to examine what comes up
- "There's so much in us that are not unlocked"

Courage, willpower, bravery all expand the box of what feels possible in our life
