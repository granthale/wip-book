**Documents**
- Values (include best practices for mental health practices)
- Strategic plans (link to other long term documents as useful, quarterly or semester-long, review strategic plans 1x per week, overhaul 2x a year)
	- Career
	- Personal

**Productivity**
- Values plan (any values that need to be shored up)
- Weekly plan (flexible, very complicated weeks require lots of thought)
- Daily plan (create time block plan based on weekly plan and value plan)

**Daily shutdown**
- Rough but intentional plan for time following shutdown
- Process any outstanding tasks

**Discipline**
- Core disciplines to follow as strictly as possible (sometimes tracked using a habit tracker)

[My Approach to multi-scale planning](https://www.asyncagile.org/blog/multi-scale-planning)
- When planning for performance review
	- Identify focus area
	- Identify all goals
	- Prioritize goals
	- Break goals down into activities
	- Ask what evidence proves I've accomplished this
	- Identify support needed to succeed
- Weekly planning
	- Put dummy event at beginning of week with personal and professional goals
	- Put time down to review goals at the end of the week
