**The 5 Best Time Management Tips (for ultra busy people)**
1. Be honest with people on why I'm declining (this will make others value my time and commitment, force me to be honest with myself on what's more important, free up mental energy)
2. Make a list of all my tiny annoyances and resolve them
3. If it's not on my calendar, it doesn't exist
4. Get info out of brain and into systems/paper
5. For decisions that don't matter that much, don't overthink. Just make the decision and move on
